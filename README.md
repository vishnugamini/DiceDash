Pig is a simple dice game. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

## Gameplay

<ul>
<li>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".</li>

<li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>

<li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>

<li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>

<li>The first player to score 50 or more points wins.</li>
</ul>
